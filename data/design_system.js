    description: "When I joined Tessell, I had the responsibility of creating our design system helped us moved faster together. When I started, I found out there existed a figma file called “Brand Book” which was lacking crucial component styles minimal, was seldom used, heavily under-documented and failed to translate into the front-end system. By the time I was done with the project, I had established principles and values for design system, a through component library, documentation and a practice of critique and governance on the design side to evolve the system, and had kick-started the process on the engineering side to make the design system a shared priority between design and engineering.",

The governance process I established created more opportunities for designers to work together, getting early visibility into how the system was emerging across the product. Currently we are hiring a dedicated front engineer to pull the visual system into code."

Designers usually built each component from scratch for each feature request and often resorted to using font styles, sizes, colors beyond the design system as the design system didn't cater their needs."

As the product had grown to a massive size with multiple app families with multiple apps in each, I decided to do a stochastic sampling of pages. I then listed out the font and color variants used in each, and also tagged if those existed in the current design system. I also took note of the figma file for each page and noted the inconsistencies that arose going from figma to finished product."

Since design system is a design team led effort (which is a significant stray from customer request led features), pitching the stakeholders on the need was crucial. As most of our stakeholders were from a very technical background, we needed to clearly convey what design system means and what efforts will be involved. Finally but most importantly we had to showcase the impact of having a design system from a business perspective, proving with evidence that investing in design system was a worthwhile business decision."
